- Improve error handling. Currently I'm using runtime asserts.
- Package definitions to help with transpile. add package name to begin of each module declaration
- Currently the extern libname isnt used at all
- Add positions to expressions?
- Allow empty init/cond/post in for loop statement
- Single token expression should be placed into a single statement
