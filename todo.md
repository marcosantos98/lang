- UX
    - [ ] Improve error handling. Currently I'm using runtime asserts.
    - [ ] Check clang, use clang automagiccly
    - [ ] Autolink libraries using the provided libname in extern
- Translation
    - [ ] Package definitions to help with transpile. add package name to begin of each module declaration
    - [ ] Currently the extern libname isnt used at all
    - [ ] Type inference from struct fields
        - This should be moved to typecheker
        - Autocast doesn't work on struct fields
    - [ ] Imported files
        - [ ] Files are copied into provided main files and could be accessed only if used to remove unneccessary code
        - [ ] Currently leaks due to need of keep definitions!
    - [ ] Fix: Getting types of struct fields with more than on layer deep breaks: `foo.bar.baz`
    - [ ] Fix: `fncall(fncall2())` breaks cause transpiler places `;` at argument level
- Parser
    - [ ] Add positions to expressions?
    - [ ] Allow empty init/cond/post in for loop statement
    - [ ] Single token expression should be placed into a single statement
    - [ ] Expandable arguments
    - [ ] Fix: `<` has lower precedence than `+`
    - [x] Allow symbols on identifiers like: _, 0-9
    - [ ] Allow functions on structs
    - [ ] Add: ==, !, <=, >=
    - [ ] Change StructFieldExpr to SelectorExpr and allow `fncall().x`
- Testing
    - [ ] Maybe remove the translation tests
    - [ ] Add test for compiled executable output
